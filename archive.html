     I don’t tell people what I truly feel.<br>
Not because no one offers or reaches out <br>
I just don’t think it matters.<br>
I prefer to stay silent.<br>
In some way, it’s a habit. And also a fear,<br>
a fear of revealing my inner world.<br>
A world filled with very sharp emotions, very intense ones,<br>
with a lot of pain, wounds, scratches.<br>
I prefer not to show it to the world.<br>
I prefer to lock my mouth and keep the key to myself,<br>
never giving it to anyone.<br>
After many years of loneliness, not alone, but lonely <br>
I don’t have the ability to speak, only to listen.<br>
There is a choice in it, but it comes from fear.<br>
I don’t have the ability to dare to speak.<br>
In the end, it falls back on me.<br>
Because my storage room fills and fills,<br>
until it becomes too much.<br>
So I prefer to disappear.<br>
I truly prefer to stay silent.<br>
I’m comfortable being the listener,<br>
the one who gives a hand,<br>
and then retreats into myself,<br>
fighting my demons alone.<br>
Those battles leave scratches,<br>
and sharp pain.<br>
But I truly prefer that the pain be only mine.<br>
I don’t want to disturb anyone.<br>
It doesn’t matter. Others might say it does <br>
but that doesn’t change the way my mind sees things,<br>
because it’s stuck in a loop of years.<br>
I truly don’t know how to stop, how to speak, how to communicate.<br>
It’s very heavy.<br>
But I’ve learned to live with it.<br>
And it’s okay. It’s really okay.<br>
I don’t know if I’m lying to myself when I say that —<br>
but still, it’s really, really okay.<br>
I truly prefer to stay silent.<br>
It’s more comfortable for me to be on the listening side,<br>
with the smiling mask.<br>
And when I need quiet, I simply step away for a moment,<br>
and return as if nothing happened.<br>
I might say genreally that my state wasn’t good in those moments <br>
but I won’t share more than that.<br>
I’m pretty sure I will always be on the listening side,<br>
the one who gives advice.<br>
At the end of the conversation they’ll say,<br>
“Thank you, you really helped me.”<br>
I’ll smile gently and say,<br>
“No problem. I’m always here.”<br>
I have a lot of empathy for the world around me.<br>
Even though sometimes I’m very angry at it.<br>
In my eyes, there are people who don’t behave properly <br>
but I will never educate anyone.<br>
It’s none of my business.<br>
Everyone can live exactly as they want.<br>
I simply won’t take part in that person’s world.<br>
Every person carries a different world.<br>
And maybe it’s also the environment’s fault that I feel this way <br>
because many times when I did dare,<br>
when I did speak,<br>
when I did say what bothered me <br>
I received a knife.<br>
And I no longer have the strength for those stabs.<br>
So I built the mask.<br>
And probably, I will stay with it forever<br>

    The sea<br>
is beautiful<br>
pleasant and infinite<br>
it seems inviting<br>
<br>
But sometimes<br>
the sea<br>
feels like a trap<br>
it’s unpredictable<br>
<br>
The sea<br>
has mood swings<br>
unexpected ones<br>
sometimes it's stormy<br>
and sometimes it's calm<br>
<br>
The question is<br>
can you trust it?<br>
In my eyes,<br>
people who trust the sea<br>
are people who trust easily<br>
<br>
Because<br>
the sea is indeed beautiful and pleasant<br>
but will you come back from it?<br>
<br>
The sea<br>
reminds me a little of my mind<br>
sometimes<br>
it can be calm and peaceful<br>
but in an unexpected moment<br>
thoughts become stormy<br>
<br>
And then<br>
I feel<br>
like I’m drowning<br>
deep down<br>
struggling<br>
to come back up<br>
and breathe<br>
<br>
The waves<br>
are the thoughts<br>
they can be<br>
very wild<br>
and pull me<br>
even deeper<br>
just like the sea<br>
<br>
I hope<br>
that one day<br>
I’ll be able<br>
to trust my mind
like the sea.
